Catanese J, Jaeger D. Premotor Ramping of Thalamic Neuronal Activity Is Modulated by Nigral Inputs and Contributes to Control the Timing of Action Release.

All codes are in MATLAB. There's no notebook like in Pyhton, so you can't see the figures.

In this article/analysis I used in vivo electrophysiology in mice to colect and decode neuronal data from the VM/VAL Thalamus region of the brain. 
My aim was to understand whether the neuronal code reflects the decisions made by the animal and how this could allow us to predict actions with altered decisions leading to impulsive actions for example.
