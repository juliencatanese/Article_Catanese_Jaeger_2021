In this article/analysis I used in vivo electrophysiology in mice to colect and decode neuronal data from the VM/VAL Thalamus region of the brain. 
My aim was to understand whether the neuronal code reflects the decisions made by the animal and how this could allow us to predict actions with altered decisions leading to impulsive actions for example.

All codes are in MATLAB. There's no notebook like in Pyhton, so you can't see the figures.

"The basal ganglia participate with cortex and thalamus in recurrent regulatory loops that promote particular movements and inhibit premature or inappropriate movements. The output nuclei of the basal ganglia, including the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), provide inhibitory output to the thalamus, including the ventromedial, ventral anterior, and ventral lateral nuclei (VM/VAL). The VM/VAL, in turn, send glutamatergic projections to the anterolateral premotor cortex to activate motor plans. Thus, SNr inhibits movement initiation and the inhibition of SNr allows motor preparation to proceed. Catanese and Jaeger elucidate how this circuit works to promote action in a delayed choice task in mice.

Mice were trained to lick a left or right water spout in response to an air puff, but they had to wait until an auditory cue was presented before initiating the response. Recordings of single units in the VM/VAL revealed that the spike rate of most individual neurons increased at different points during trials. This was manifest at the population level by a ramping up of activity across the delay period, with activity peaking shortly before the onset of licking. Notably, the rate of ramping was faster on trials in which mice licked before the go cue was presented than on trials when licks were properly timed. Conversely, no ramping was apparent in trials in which mice failed to lick. Consequently, a linear classifier was able to decode performance from the population activity during the delay period. As predicted from previous work, activation of channelrhodopsin-expressing SNr terminals reduced firing of target neurons in the VM/VAL. Remarkably, this reduced the number of premature licks and increased the number of trials on which licking was omitted.

Based on these and previous results, the authors propose that the VM/VAL is under tonic inhibition from the SNr, which suppresses the production of unintentional movements. To initiate a specific action, the activity of subsets of SNr neurons must be inhibited. This allows VM/VAL activity to increase, and when the activity surpasses a threshold, it activates motor commands in prefrontal cortex. Such a design would not only prevent random or impulsive movements, but would also allow precise timing of sequential movements in complex behaviors."
